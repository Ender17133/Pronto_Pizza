# Imaginary Data Analysis/Business Analytics task 
by: Beibarys Nyussupov 

After receiving your report, Tony Scapelli decided to delay the 29-minute guarantee program until after
collecting additional data based on your recommendations. Tony also decided to hire two additional
drivers for Friday and -Saturday deliveries. Over a period of five weeks, Tony monitored deliveries and
collected data on the same variables as in his first data collection. To avoid the sampling bias of the
earlier data, Tony sampled every 10th pizza delivery order. He carefully measured the time required to
prepare the order and the amount of time it had to wait for a driver to become available. Instead of
going on the delivery to measure the travel time, Tony phoned ahead to the waiting customer and
offered a discount coupon if the customer would call back with the exact time the Pizza arrived. In this
way, Tony hoped to avoid the potential for response bias with the delivery person. At the end of the
five-week period, Tony had collected data on 324 deliveries.
Assignment: Once again, Tony is relying on you to provide an analysis of the new data that he has
collected and to recommend whether or not be should offer the 29-minute guarantee on Pronto Pizza
deliveries. He is committed to going with the 29-minute delivery guarantee unless the data strongly
indicate that the percentage of free pizzas given away due to late deliveries exceeds the 5% break-even
point.

Thoroughly analyze the new data collected by Tony contained in the file ProntoRevisited. Write a
statistical consulting report detailing your analysis and your recommendation on the 29-minute
guarantee. Be sure to discuss any other innovative things that Tony might do in order to improve his
pizza delivery process and compete with his new rival.
